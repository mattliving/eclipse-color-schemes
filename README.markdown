COPYRIGHT NOTICE:
=================

The color schemes and the abovementioned site are NOT MY WORK.

I mirror them here for my (and your) convenience, because the original site
is being targeted by spammers, and the code quality of the `.epf` files was
a little lacking (some contained color-unrelated Eclipse settings).

What is this?
-------------

These are the Eclipse colorschemes originally from [eclipsecolorthemes.jottit.com] [1].

Visit the original site for more info, and to add more color schemes to the
original collection!

But be _careful_ with foreign `.epf` files, or you risk messing up your *entire*
Eclipse configuration.

How to use the `.epf` files
-------------------------

- Review the settings
- In Eclipse, import the preferences from the `.epf` file

Also, see this [Stackoverflow thread] [2].


* Have fun!*
