COPYRIGHT NOTICE:
=================

The color schemes and the abovementioned site are NOT MY WORK.

I mirror them here for my (and your) convenience, because the original site
is being targeted by spammers, and the code quality of the `.epf` files was
a little lacking (some contained color-unrelated Eclipse settings).

The color schemes have been created/converted by [anonfunc] [1].

What is this?
-------------

These are the Eclipse colorschemes originally uploaded to [eclipsecolorthemes.jottit.com] [2].

Visit the original site for more info, and to add more color schemes to the
original collection!

But be __careful__ with foreign `.epf` files, or you risk messing up your *entire*
Eclipse configuration.

How to use the .epf files
-------------------------

- Review the settings
- In Eclipse, import the preferences from the `.epf` file
- Enjoy your new color scheme

Also, see the [Stackoverflow thread that kicked it all off] [3].


*Have fun!*
