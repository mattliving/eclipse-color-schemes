COPYRIGHT NOTICE:
=================

The color schemes and the abovementioned site are NOT MY WORK.

I mirror them here for my (and your) convenience, because the original site
is being targeted by spammers, and the code quality of the .epf files was
a little lacking (some contained color-unrelated Eclipse settings).

What is this?
-------------

These are the Eclipse colorschemes originally from
http://eclipsecolorthemes.jottit.com/

I mirrored them for your forking pleasure.
Visit the original site for more info, and to add more color schemes to the
original collection!

But be careful with foreign .epf files, or you risk messing up your *entire*
Eclipse configuration.

How to use the .epf files
-------------------------

- Review the settings
- In Eclipse, import the preferences from the .epf file

Have fun!
